# Phitter v1.0.3

**Release Date:** 15/April/2025

This release includes some bug fixes. We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Changes:

- The calculation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic has been corrected. Previously, the function returned the D‚Å∫ statistic (the upper one-tailed test statistic) now we return the D statistic.
- The correction has been applied solely to the value of the statistic; the p-value calculation remains accurate and is still based on the same theoretical foundation.
